# THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

- i play tf2 at 1920 x 1080 and do not plan to add support for other resolutions (test and see if it works though!)

- the "#Customizations" folder is for zeeshud main menu only (drag enablefriends out of _enabled to disable friends list)

- the customization folder you should use is BasicHudCustomizations for hud customizations

- i suck ass at hud stuff so if something is broken sorry

- if you use custom ui sounds i would delete all the sounds in the sound/ui folder except for boing, meow, and byebye (these are used for specific buttons)

- if sounds are ear piercing this is just tf2 being tf2 delete the sound.cache folder

- you may notice the numerous clientschemes from hud merger, if theres a hud there that isnt in the credits it was used at one point but none of its assets are used now


# ISSUES I KNOW ABOUT CURRENTLY

- none! woo!
