# THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

- if your hud/assets are in here and you dont want it in this just lmk i'll take it out :steamhappy:

- please install fonts inside of resource/fonts and resource/scheme/fonts so the huds fonts work

- have music volume up ingame, sv_pure 1 sound utility script uses this volume option, having it set to 0 will make you not hear certain sounds

- i play tf2 at 1920 x 1080 and do not plan to add support for other resolutions if they dont work (test and see if it works though!)

- the "#Customizations" folder is for zeeshud main menu only (drag enablefriends out of _enabled to disable friends list)

- the customization folder you should use is BasicHudCustomizations for hud customizations

- i suck ass at hud stuff so if something is broken sorry

- if you use custom ui sounds i would delete all the sounds in the sound/ui folder except for boing, meow, and byebye (these are used for specific buttons the hud uses and do not override your own)

- if sounds are glitchy/loud this is just tf2 being tf2 delete the sound.cache folder (also please tell me what sound is causing it in issues so i can look into it please thanks)

# ISSUES I KNOW ABOUT CURRENTLY

- cornered health does not show in 4:3 but im really not bothered to fix that :3
